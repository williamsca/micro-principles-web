### Office Hours

Monday 3:30 -- 4:30pm, Wednesday 9 -- 11:00am, Monroe Hall Basement

### Required Text

[@colander_microeconomics_2023]. By default, all students are billed through SIS for access to a digital copy of the textbook. Students may access the text on McGraw Hill's Connect platform using the link on the Collab page. In addition to the textbook itself, Connect includes a wealth of supplementary material that students sometimes find useful, including chapter quizzes and practice problems.

### Objectives

This discussion will supplement Mr. Elzinga's lectures, provide an opportunity for you to ask questions about the material, and give you a chance to practice the concepts you learn in class.

### Grading

Of the 400 points possible in Econ 2010, 25 (6.25\%) are directly attached to this discussion section:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Weekly Quizzes (10 points)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item All discussions will end with a 3-question quiz
        \item Students who complete at least 3/4 of all quizzes will earn 5 points
        \item Students will receive 1 point for each quiz in which they answer at least 2/3 of the questions correctly, for a maximum of 5 points
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Class Presentation (15 points)}. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Students will upload slides for a brief presentation twice during the semester
        \item I will randomly sample half of the class (without replacement) to present on each date\footnote{If you expect to be absent on a presentation date, let me know at least 24 hours in advance.}
        \item Both slide decks and the presentation will be graded on a 0-5 scale for a total of 15 points
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

### Presentations

The goal of the presentation is for you to think like an "undercover economist." You will present a real-world example of one of the concepts that we've studied in class. You should explain the concept, describe the example, and then explain how the example illustrates the concept. This can be done well in five minutes using three slides, though you may use more if you wish.

Concepts in Econ 2010 are broadly applicable to business, policy, and personal decisions. I welcome a wide range of examples and encourage students to draw on other courses, popular media, and their own lives. If you are unsure about your example, you are welcome to ask me during office hours or by email.

Newspapers are another good source of inspiration. The UVA Library offers students a free digital subscription to the *New York Times*. You may also find *The Economist* and *The Wall Street Journal* useful; paper copies of the latter are available in Clemons Library. You should have no difficulty finding stories about movements in supply or demand curves, arbitrage, price controls, price elasticities, or opportunity costs.

### Grade Disputes

I will grade your midterms. If you disagree with how a question is marked, see me in office hours to discuss the question. You may then appeal your grade to the head TA by completing the grade appeal form on Canvas. Only after discussing your grade with the head TA will you be permitted to appeal to Mr. Elzinga. The deadline for appeals is three weeks after the exam date.
